                  As a junior React Native developer and technical program
                  manager, I am a versatile professional who excels in bridging
                  the gap between design and code. My skills encompass
                  translating Figma designs into functional UI/UX, crafting
                  front-end screens, integrating APIs, and optimizing code. I
                  actively engage in gathering client requirements, identifying
                  pain points, enhancing user experiences, and creating
                  technical documentation. During development, I breathe life
                  into designs, manage databases, and contribute to research and
                  tool selection. I also act as a client liaison, seamlessly
                  incorporating feedback, manage cross-functional teams,
                  facilitate testing, and ensure successful product releases. My
                  ability to single-handedly manage support and maintenance
                  demonstrates my all-encompassing approach to project
                  management and development.{" "}
